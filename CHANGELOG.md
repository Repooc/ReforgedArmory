v1.13 7/??/2025

• Update missing enchant ids (thanks to Translit)
• fixed some issues where skin is disabled
• can now see rotate buttons again on inspect frame
• add option for model controls in character frame
• add basic durability bar
• Users can use the Enchant Strings section to not only alter the text of a given enchant if they provide the enchant id but it will now allow you to add missing ids and the text to display when that enchant is found so they do not have to wait for an update before that enchant text is visible
